#### Hi everyone!

I am TarÄ±k. I am an automation tester. I use the Java programming language and the Selenium tool in my projects. For mobile automation, I use Appium. Additionally, I conduct database tests using JDBC. 
I am currently learning JavaScript. I'm actively attempting to use GitHub. 

Other than that, I like listening to music and walking. I especially love walking while listening to music too much. ðŸ˜„ (Those who know me know, I go out to every sunday evening for listening to music while walking. ðŸ˜Š) Although I like mostly instrumental and ethnic music, I have recently become interested in symphonic metal music. 

I don't watch many movies, but when I want to watch it, I prefer arthouse movies. I don't watch serials because I'm not interesting to them.
